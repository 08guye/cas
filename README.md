# CAS Documentation


## Requirements
Strictly speaking, the only tools required to craft documentation are the standard development tools. You'll need [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to generate the site for preview purposes, but it's not strictly required.  
If you encounter the following error:

```ruby
runner.rb:365:in 'require_program': program version required (Commander::Runner::CommandError)
...
custom_require.rb:36:in 'gem_original_require': no such file to load -- json (LoadError)
```

It means that the json gem is missing: `gem install json` should solve the problem...

###Windows
* You'll need to have Python 2.7.6 installed
* You'll need to have Ruby 1.9.3 installed

## Getting Started

1. `git clone git@github.com:Jasig/cas.git cas.site`
2. `git checkout gh-pages`
3. Change documentation as necessary
4. `git push --set-upstream origin gh-pages`

The changes should be almost immediately available at http://jasig.github.io/cas/.


## Local Site Generation

### Markdown Engine
[kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/) is the markdown engine used by the site. You'll need to download kramdown before attempting to run the build. See [documentation](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/installation.html) for platform-specific details.

### Build
Generating the site to preview changes _before_ commit is encouraged. Install [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and execute the following command from the documentation root directory:

```bash
jekyll build --safe
```

Browse to the output directory `_site` in a browser to preview the generated site.

Alternatively, you may also invoke the documentation build script:

```bash
build.[bat|sh]
```

The build will auto-generate tags for section headers.

## Site Structure
The documentation site is composed of the following blocks:

- Each version of the documentation is moved to an appropriately named folder (i.e. `4.0.0`)
- Each version contains its own version of the sidebar TOC. While the TOC is designed to be included in the default
Jekyll layout, the site will load the appropriate version of the TOC on `jasig.github.io/cas`.
- The `current` folder contains the version of the documentation in development
- Developer-related documentation is hosted at the root under the `developer` directory
- The root `index.html` always points to the `current\index.html` page.
- Page titles are auto-calculated based on the first `h1` element on the page, followed by the version of the
documentation (i.e. `Service Management (x.y.z)`)


## Troubleshooting
If you have trouble getting jekyll to build, try the following:

* Make sure python is included in your $PATH
* If you are receiving unicode incompatibility errors, try the command `chcp 65001`
* There exists a bug with Jekyll 1.4.3 that does not properly utilize file separators. You may have to downgrade to Jekyll 1.4.2 or upgrade to the next 2.x release.
