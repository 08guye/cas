# Mailing Lists

The CAS project has a number of topical mailing lists (now under the apereo.org domain) that are available to obtain support or participate in CAS
development.

It's important to note that, while CAS has an international audience, discussion takes place in English.
The community is very understanding of non-native English speakers and generally exercises patience and persistence
in those circumstances. _Please post in English._


## CAS Community List (cas-user)
_Focus_: support, troubleshooting, general questions.

Post to this list if you have a question about installing, configuring, or troubleshooting CAS.

## CAS Developer List (cas-dev)
_Focus_: CAS developer discussion and collaboration.

The developer list is used by CAS committers to discuss CAS development. It's a suitable forum for discussing feature
requests, software design, and offering contributions. _Please do not post support questions to the developer list._

[CAS lists](http://listes.esup-portail.org/wws/lists/cas).
