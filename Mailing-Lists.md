# Mailing Lists

The CAS project uses the WiscList mailing list software and infrastructure graciously provided by the
Univeristy of Wisconsin. A number of topical mailing lists are available to obtain support or participate in CAS
development.

It's important to note that, while CAS has an international audience, discussion takes place in English.
The community is very understanding of non-native English speakers and generally exercises patience and persistence
in those circumstances. _Please post in English._

## CAS Community Discussion List (cas-user)
_Focus_: support, troubleshooting, general questions.

Post to this list if you have a question about installing, configuring, or troubleshooting CAS.

## CAS Developer List (cas-dev)
_Focus_: CAS developer discussion and collaboration.

The developer list is used by CAS committers to discuss CAS development. It's a suitable forum for discussing feature
requests, software design, and offering contributions. _Please do not post support questions to the developer list._

## CAS Announcements List (cas-announce)
_Focus_: release accouncements.

This is a low-traffic list to receive notifications about CAS releases including security patches.

## Unsubscribing
Send a message to the following address: `leave-[listname]@lists.wisc.edu`. The subject and body may be empty.
You should receive a confirmation message indicating you have successfully unsubscribed.

_NOTE_: The most common mistake unsubscribing from a mailing list is sending a message to `listname@lists.jasig.org`.
That has the effect of announcing intent to leave without actually accomplishing anything.
It's the mailing list equivalent of storming out of a room and walking into a closed door. Embarrassing.

## Foreign Language Lists

The ESUP-Portail project has fostered the growth of several French-language
[CAS lists](http://listes.esup-portail.org/wws/lists/cas).
