### Step 1: Search List Archives
The [Google Groups mirror](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jasig-cas-user) of the community discussion list
provides an excellent search interface for list archives.
In countless cases a particular question has been asked and answered multiple times.
Please search the archives before posting to the community discussion list.

### Step 2: Post to the Community Discussion List
The CAS community discussion mailing list is a moderate traffic list where questions are typically answered on the
order of minutes and typically resolved within a couple days. CAS developers monitor the list and frequently
participate in discussion. See the [Mailing Lists](Mailing-Lists.html) page for subscription and etiquette.

## Conferences
The [Apereo Foundation](http://www.apereo.org/) (formerly Jasig) offers a number of conferences that provide
presentations and training on a number of software products, including CAS, that are relevant to Higher Education.
Conferences are an excellent venue for strengthening ties to the larger CAS community and related open source software
ecosystem.
