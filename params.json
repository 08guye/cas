The Central Authentication Service (CAS) is the standard mechanism by which web applications should authenticate users. \r\n\r\nCAS provides enterprise single sign-on service:\r\n\r\n- [An open and well-documented protocol][protocol]\r\n- An open-source Java server component\r\n- [A library of clients for Java, .Net, PHP, Perl, Apache, uPortal, and others](https://wiki.jasig.org/display/CASC/Official+Clients)\r\n- [Integrates with uPortal, BlueSocket, TikiWiki, Mule, Liferay, Moodle and others](https://wiki.jasig.org/display/CAS/CASifying+Applications)\r\n- Community documentation and implementation support\r\n- An extensive community of adopters\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nCAS requires J2SE 1.6, J2EE1.3 and a servlet container that can handle JSP 2.0 (e.g., Tomcat 5.0.28)\r\n\r\n## Build\r\nIt is recommended to build and deploy CAS locally using the [Maven War Overlay method](https://wiki.jasig.org/display/CASUM/Best+Practice+-+Setting+Up+CAS+Locally+using+the+Maven2+WAR+Overlay+Method). This approach does not require the adopter to *explicitly* download any version of CAS, but rather utilizes Maven's overlay mechanism to combine CAS original artifacts and local customozations to further ease future upgrades and maintenance.\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n- Binary releases may be downloaded from [here](http://www.jasig.org/cas/download).\r\n- CAS artifacts are published through the [Maven Central Repository.](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jasig.cas)\r\n- A snapshot of the codebase's `master` branch may be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/Jasig/cas/archive/master.zip).\r\n- Snapshot artifacts are also published through the [Sonatype snapashots repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/jasig/cas/) under the group id **`org.jasig.cas`**.\r\n- The codebase may also be *cloned* using a Git client via the following command:\r\n`git clone git@github.com:Jasig/cas.git`\r\n\r\n**Note:** If building CAS from the source, running the test cases currently requires an active Internet connection.\r\nPlease [see the maven docs][skip] on how to disable the tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n- [CAS Protocol][protocol]\r\n- [CAS User Manual](https://wiki.jasig.org/display/CASUM/Home)\r\n- [Javadocs](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/org/jasig/cas/) \r\nJavadocs may also be created locally using the Maven command: `mvn clean site site:stage` and will then be available at the `target/staging` folder of the root project directory.\r\n- [Release Notes](https://issues.jasig.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10007)\r\n\r\n## Addons\r\n- [CAS Addons](https://github.com/Unicon/cas-addons) is an open source collection of useful JASIG-CAS server addons.\r\n\r\n## Contributions\r\n- [How to contribute to Jasig](http://www.jasig.org/jasig/contribute)\r\n- [Contributor guidelines](https://github.com/Jasig/cas/wiki/Contributor-Guidelines)\r\n- [CAS code conventions](https://wiki.jasig.org/display/CAS/Code+Conventions)\r\n\r\n[protocol]: http://www.jasig.org/cas/protocol\r\n[skip]: http://maven.apache.org/general.html#skip-test","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
